### Foreword

Writing this document began as an expanded version of another quickstart document, authored by Jordi Torres and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jorditorresBCN/Quick-Start/blob/main/Git-Github-Quick-Start.md ).  It has undergone several full rewrites and has grown to become an almost 30 page long manual in the form of a step by step tutorial.

As the original document put together by Jordi Torres, it is meant as a hands-on introduction for beginners to both GitHub and GitLab.  It should get you started and operational from scratch under two to three hours.  It deals with the most salient aspects of how to get on and about with git version control.  If you would rather have a lengthier, more detailed and well illustrated description of git’s concepts and general philosophy, I can refer to “Pro git” by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, a 514 page long freely available [digital reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).  This Quickstart tutorial was not written with "Pro git" in hand and is not a summary of that book. In fact I have not read “Pro git” (yet) even though I occasionally do consult it.

Corrections and suggestions are welcome and should be consigned in the Issues section of [this repo](https://www.github.com/Cbhihe/quickstart_git/issues).
